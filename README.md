# Weather App
**Welcome to Weather App:  Trying out async Javascript**

This was done during my time learning JS in the 11th week with the Generation Australia program. The goal of this project is to create an app that uses [openweather.org](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to grab the current weather in a location of your choice.

**What does this project entail?**
-  [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
-  [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
-  [Async Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)  

**Limitations**
-   Took around 4-6 hours to complete this project

**Special Thanks To**
-   Generation Australia
-   Aaron Byrom
